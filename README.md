# Sketchpad

Harkening back to the beloved Etch A Sketch toy, this Sketchpad site allows the user to choose how many 'pixels' there are on the canvas, and then draw and shade with their mouse to realize their vision.

<h2>How To</h2>
<ol>
<li>To start a new drawing, click the Reset button.</li>
<li>You will be prompted to type an integer from 1-100, indicating how many squares you want in each row of your canvas grid (a higher number allows for more detailed drawing).</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
<li>Start moving your mouse around the screen to draw. Mousing over the same square will darken it from white to black, allowing for shading.</li>
</ol>
